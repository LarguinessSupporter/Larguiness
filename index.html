            </div>
            <p class="lead">This is directly taken from Larguiness’ head. A lucky man used the power of Harry Potter to escape Larguiness and write it down. This is it, as it was presented.<br/>
1. Don’t die, it’s not healthy<br/>
2. Hail ME!!!!!!1!!!<br/>
3. Only think of me<br/>
4. I am the true God<br/>
5. You shall die<br/>
6. Larguiness is not a meme<br/>
7. Get good at tetris<br/>
8. Jebus is the true devil<br/>
9. Nuke all<br/>
10. Cars goes ka-chow<br/>
If you shunt follow this, you shall be dead in 4-8 business days</p>
            <p class="mb-5  ">Wonse upon a ther was a lovely lorde and savour. Name of it’s being Larguiness. He is as a mighty being as better then the lord tractor. Now? This almighty pokemon is based on the orginal 12th gen egg-eck-e-door but it has a tree growing on the rightmost, bottom most arm. This tree begins as a green and prosperus tree, then magestically transfers into a blue and dull, carrot tree. Larguiness lives the most rich and delicious eagle territory. Inside of the undermost cave in the underground portion of mt. Everest. In his cave they’re is a aMAZING shrek, who refuses to leave the side of his dankey cayne. This dankey only ates the finest of memes every 2nd tuedays of the forth moon, after the eighth harvest after the flood of the tree ripper after the molenoid has laid its 8th egg of the weak. This dankeys’ ear resides in Larguinesses’ quiver, thus according to Eula’s number Larguiness is an omnipresent being. Einstein’s law for general relativity states that due to the fact that Larguiness is better then the lord tractor that the lord tractor thus must be ahpart of Larguiness. This is clearly seen in the fact of the matta that Larguiness is holding a guitar and a book with the vary ambiguous title “BOOK”… Despite the meaning of Larguiness being “The overpowerd war lord of the hell being of the hell and in this he has gained over the many o’ years 2 antanai and a beer bottle extruding from his antanai.” This title has been gained over the many years of living in the lord Jebus’i’s house. The weapons that he is always seen holding was ‘borrowed’ from the lord Jebus’i’s basement and attik. These weapons locations can clearly be indicated by which arms they are being held by. The ones gained from the attik being held on Larguiness’ lower arms and the ones gained from the basement being located on the upper arms. Larguiness is the most formal of all pokemon and has catched them all so he always try’s and look formal. Wearing a tie and a bow tie to not upset any preferences.  He luvs roleplaying so much that indead he roleplays so many things at wunse. These roleplays being: spy man; teenage girl and professional track runner. These are clearly stated by the wearing of spy glasses, extreeemly short shorts and shoes with overkilllly long spikes duck taped to the bottom of his feet. Despite this quite bootiful features, Larguiness has 1 very large unbootiful features. This features was gained from borrowing Jebus’i’s secret stash of weapons of mass destruction. Due to the borrowing being 2 long for Jebus’i’s licking. Jebus’i banished Larguiness 788048745 seconds of solitary confinement in the basement of ‘ell. During this period of time Larguiness gained 4 devil horns. 2 of these horns are only severely undergrown. Thus these implies that therefore Larguiness has not become a devil but rather lost the ability to become a devil. This means that if Larguiness was killed by the only way he can die; a broken window shard from the pit of everlasting no return; he will not die but infact just be reincarnated as a very slightly larger “The overpowerd war lord of the hell being of the hell and in this he has gained over the many o’ years 2 antanai and a beer bottle extruding from his antanai.” Larguiness has spent over 17 hours in Tetris and during those years he came up with general laws that humanity and all not human humanity should follow. These are:

They are in Larguinesses head so u must ask him
Larguiness refers to himself in third person to add the persona of mysterious. He hands have the lacking ability of fine motor skills thus preventing him from writing them himself. He also prevents anyone else from writing them down by chopping their hands off and removing there mouth as well as all other means of communication.</p>
